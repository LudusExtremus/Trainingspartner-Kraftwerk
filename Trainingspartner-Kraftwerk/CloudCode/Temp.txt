Your Cloud Code has been created at C:\Users\canad\Documents\Trainingspartner App\Trainingspartner-Kraftwerk\CloudCode.

This includes a "Hello world" cloud function, so once you deploy,
you can test that it works, with the printed curl command.

Next, you might want to deploy this code with:

        cd C:\Users\canad\Documents\Trainingspartner App\Trainingspartner-Kraftwerk\CloudCode
        parse deploy

Once deployed you can test that it works by running:
curl -X POST \
 -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: O40o7ZAc0abwQZZsWO8p6VNCzDEbkLwLqqCBq3Fm" \
 -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: XZ8ECp387Hrd6f1ey2YRRywVXAP18OL4aLshNwtw" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{}' \
